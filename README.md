For a comprehensive road accident analysis using Power BI Desktop, the initial step involved importing and rigorously cleaning the dataset to ensure data accuracy. Employing DAX functions was instrumental in crafting advanced calculations, enhancing the depth of understanding within the dataset. The subsequent development of visualizations effectively portrayed patterns and trends in road accidents. The primary objective was to derive valuable insights, aiding in the identification and comprehension of critical factors influencing road safety. To communicate these findings, a dynamic dashboard was created in Power BI Service, offering real-time exploration and interaction with the road accident data. This analytical approach provided a holistic perspective, facilitating informed decision-making in the domain of road safety.
